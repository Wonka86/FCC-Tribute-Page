</h3>
  
  <p> 
  Belegar has established himself as a master of subterranean warfare. 
  On his orders are enemy probes smashed,  ambushes overcome and infiltration paths blockaded. 
  Yet Belegar is not content to sit behind his fortifications, and many times he has led assaults into the underhalls of his forefathers.
    
There, from the shattered remains of his ancestorsâ€™ tombs, Belegar claimed the rune-struck chunk of rock that now serves as his Oath Stone.</p>
  <p>
    
 It is said amongst Dwarfs that his warrior skills are second only to those of the Slayer King,and that at need, Belegar can summon the vengeful powers of his ancestors.
    
  Yet for all his victories, Belegar remains embittered,  vowing to one day reclaim all of Karak Eight Peaks for his own.</p>
